The Description about the task

The given Python script is a secure file encryption and decryption tool that uses AES-256 encryption through the cryptography library. It provides both command-line             

functionality and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The core encryption mechanism derives a secure 256-bit key from a user-provided password using PBKDF2      
with SHA-256 and a randomly generated salt to ensure strong key randomness and resistance against brute-force attacks. The tool encrypts files by reading their content,        
encrypting it with Fernet (which uses AES under the hood), and saving the encrypted data along with the salt to a new file with a .enc extension. For decryption, it reads     
the salt and encrypted data from the file, derives the key using the password, and attempts to decrypt the content, saving it with a .dec extension. The GUI allows users to   
select files, enter a password, and perform encryption or decryption actions with just a few clicks, making it user-friendly and practical for protecting sensitive data.

The given AES-256 encryption and decryption tool can be used in a wide range of real-world scenarios where file security and confidentiality are essential
